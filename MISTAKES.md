# Mistakes

Repo-specific failures and what would have prevented them. Newest first.

## 2026-09-12 — Prettier silently rewrote a literal asterisk to an underscore in a markdown doc

**What happened:** Fixing a pre-existing `lint` (Prettier) failure on `docs/goals/done/epic-ten-goals.md`, an initial `prettier --write` on the real file changed the meaning of two glob patterns written as plain text: `reqts/goal-*.md` became `reqts/goal-_.md`, and `three pr-*-draft.md files` became `three pr-_-draft.md files`. Exit code was 0 and the only signal was "reformatted" — nothing flagged the text change.

**Root cause:** the file has two bare, unescaped `*` characters outside any code span. CommonMark's delimiter-run algorithm paired them as an (unintended) emphasis span across the whole document; Prettier's markdown printer re-serialized that span using `_` as the emphasis marker, which touches only the delimiter characters, not the content between them, so the diff looked like two isolated, unrelated single-character swaps rather than one obvious formatting change.

**Consequence:** would have merged a factually wrong glob pattern into an archived, done epic's evidence record, with no test or reviewer likely to catch a single silently-swapped character in prose.

**Prevention:** before running `prettier --write` on a markdown file with untested output, diff the result and read every changed line, not just confirm exit 0. A bare `*` or `_` in plain markdown text that is meant literally must be escaped (`\*`) before formatting, especially in file-path or glob text. `command grep -n '\*'` (or `_`) across a doc before formatting it surfaces every candidate quickly.

## 2026-09-05 — Recommended re-running a Publish run whose main package had already shipped

**What happened:** Publish v0.47.12 had published `pipecraft` and failed only on the skill
package (404, missing Trusted Publisher). After James added the publisher I recommended
`gh run rerun 33879945462`. Attempt 2 failed at "Publish to npm (using OIDC)" with "You
cannot publish over the previously published versions: 0.47.12", and the skill step never
ran.

**Root cause:** `publish.yml` publishes the main package unconditionally, so a re-run of a
half-successful release fails before reaching the step it was re-run for. I read the failed
step of attempt 1 and not the steps before it.

**Consequence:** one approved outward action spent on a run that could not test the fix; the
Trusted Publisher stays unverified until the next fresh release.

**Prevention:** before recommending a re-run, list the run's steps and ask which of them are
idempotent. A publish step that already succeeded will fail on re-run unless the workflow
skips an existing version, which `scripts/publish-skill.sh` does and the main-package step
does not.

## 2026-09-04 — Opened three PRs and three issues with empty bodies

**What happened:** `gh pr create --body-file` and `gh issue create --body-file` ran with a body file that a failed `sed '1{/^$/d}'` (BSD sed rejects the brace form on one line) had left empty. All six landed on GitHub with a one-character body. The approved text went in afterwards through `gh api ... -X PATCH`.
**Root cause:** the body file was produced by a pipeline and handed straight to `gh` without a size check, and `set -e` did not stop the run because the failing `sed` was inside a pipeline whose last command succeeded.
**Consequence:** six outward edits instead of six outward creates, on a repo where every outward action is approved by number.
**Prevention:** after writing any file that will go outward, print its byte count before the command that sends it, and stop on zero. Use `awk` or `sed -e '1d'` (separate expressions) rather than brace addresses on macOS.

## 2026-09-04 — Told the person running the publish by hand to publish by hand

**What happened:** The first hand run of `scripts/publish-skill.sh` got `404 Not Found -
PUT` from npm, and the script exited 0 with "Publish it once by hand, then this step takes
over". The token in `~/.npmrc` was dead: `npm whoami` returned 401.

**Root cause:** npm answers an unauthenticated PUT to a scoped package with 404, the same
status a missing package gets. The script's never-published branch was written for the CI
job, whose OIDC token cannot create a package, and it ran unchanged outside CI, where the
person it was advising was the one meant to create the package.

**Consequence:** A failed publish reported success, and the advice sent James in a circle.

**Prevention:** A 404 on `npm publish` is not proof the package is missing; check
`npm whoami` first. A branch that exists to excuse CI must be gated on being in CI.
Fixed in #595, with tests for the hand path.

## 2026-09-01 — Corrected the skill copy that never ships, and released it

**What happened:** #545 replaced `pipecraft verify` (a command that does not exist) across
every AI guidance file, including `skills/pipecraft-cli/SKILL.md`, and added a test that
scans markdown for invented commands. It released as v0.45.5. Unpacking the published
tarball afterwards showed `pipecraft verify   # Health check` still in
`dist/utils/skill-installer.js`, and no `skills/` directory at all.

**Root cause:** `getSkillContent()` reads `skills/pipecraft-cli/SKILL.md` and falls back to
an embedded string. `package.json` `files` listed `dist`, `src/generators` and `README.md`,
so the tarball carried no SKILL.md and the fallback was the only path an npm user could
reach. I corrected the copy in the repo and never checked which copy ships. The new test
scanned markdown only, so it could not see a string literal in TypeScript, and it read the
repo rather than the artifact.

**Consequence:** v0.45.5 shipped with the defect the release claimed to fix. The same scan
also missed `setup-github` printing "Run 'pipecraft edit' to create your first release";
`edit` has never been a command either.

**Prevention:** verify in the tarball, not the checkout. `npm pack`, extract, and read the
file the code actually loads. The two new cases in
`tests/unit/documented-commands-exist.test.ts` do this: one scans string literals under
`src/`, the other runs `npm pack --dry-run` and asserts the skill file is in it.

## 2026-09-01 — Ran a full e2e sweep against a checkout 15 commits behind

**What happened:** After a session of merging through worktrees, I ran
`harness.ts run all` from the parent checkout to verify the promotion gate (#280) and the
init prefixes fix (#533). The checkout was still at `7b11d8e` from that morning, 15 commits
behind `origin/develop`. `pnpm build` in the same command compiled that old source
faithfully, so the harness was exercising code from before both changes. I caught it only
because I glanced at `git log --oneline -1` for an unrelated reason.

**Root cause:** every merge went through a worktree, so nothing ever pulled the parent. I
treated "I ran `pnpm build`" as sufficient, when building guarantees the artifact matches
the working tree and says nothing about whether the working tree matches the branch. The
commit was visible in `git worktree list` output I had already read twice.

**Consequence:** none, caught before reporting. Had it completed, all six flavors would have
gone green — they passed that morning too — and I would have reported a sweep that proved
nothing about the changes it was meant to verify.

**Prevention:** before any e2e run or integration verification, confirm the checkout is
current: `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/develop` must be 0. A green result from stale
code is worse than a red one, because it ends the investigation.

This is the same shape as the `filter: blob:none` measurement earlier that day, which showed
no saving twice because the local server lacked `uploadpack.allowFilter`. Right command,
wrong conditions, plausible output.

## 2026-08-31 — Rewrote generateReleaseItConfig while an open issue described a third bug in it

**What happened:** I rewrote `VersionManager.generateReleaseItConfig()` in v0.43.2 to fix
two bugs: it read `versioning.bumpRules` instead of `semver.bumpRules`, and
`JSON.stringify` dropped its `whatBump` function. Open issue #287 describes a third bug in
the same function. `Math.min.apply(Math, commits.map(...))` returns `Infinity` when
`commits` is empty, which is an invalid bump level. My rewrite carried that straight over
as `Math.min(...commits.map(...))`.

`src/templates/release-it.cjs.tpl.ts`, the path `generate` actually uses, handles this
correctly and returns `{ level: null, reason: 'No commits found - skipping release' }`. It
also quotes the `'after:release'` hook key, which is #287's other half. So the shipped
config is fine and only the `VersionManager` copy carries the gap — the exact
inconsistency between the two generators that I had rewritten the method to remove.

**Root cause:** I scoped the work to the bug I was handed and never asked what was already
known about this code. One `gh issue list` would have surfaced #287. I ran it only when
James asked about open issues, after two releases had shipped.

**Consequence:** v0.43.2 went out with a filed, one-line bug still sitting in a function I
had just rewritten line by line. Closing it needs another PR and another release cascade.

**Prevention:** Before rewriting a function here, search the tracker for its name and its
file. This repo has 27 open issues, several describing exact defects in generators and
composite actions, so the odds that the thing you are touching is already filed are high.

**Correction, same day:** the entry above, and the CLAUDE.md note it pointed at, both said
`generateReleaseItConfig` was reachable only from unit tests. That was wrong, and I asserted
it twice without running the search that settles it. `grep -rn 'generateReleaseItConfig' src/`
finds `versioning.ts` calling it inside `setupVersionManagement()`, which `src/cli/index.ts`
calls under `pipecraft init --with-versioning`, and which then writes `.release-it.cjs` into
the user's repo. The `Infinity` bug was live for those users, not dormant. Two lessons, and
the second is the sharper one: a claim about what calls a function is a negative claim, so it
needs `grep` behind it (see the global log's pattern watch); and "this code is not reachable"
is the most load-bearing sentence you can write about a bug, so it earns the most evidence.

## 2026-08-31 — A "skip if it exists" write hid both a product bug and a test leak for months

**What happened:** Pinion skips writing any file that already exists, so `generate` never
updated `enforce-pr-target.yml` or `pr-title-check.yml` after the first run. Renaming
`finalBranch` left the old branch enforced; adding a commit type to `semver.bumpRules` left
PR titles using it rejected. `generate` printed "Skipped file" and exited 0, so nothing
looked wrong. This repo's own `enforce-pr-target.yml` had silently missed the trigger
scoping and promote-branch guard added to the template in #480.

Rendering those two templates with `{ force: true }` then exposed a second bug hiding behind
the first: `tests/unit/job-order.test.ts` ran the CLI with `cwd: process.cwd()`, the repo
root. It redirected the pipeline with `--output-pipeline`, but the auxiliary workflows are
written relative to cwd, so they landed in this repo's own `.github/workflows`. Previously
those writes were skipped and invisible; with force they clobbered the real files, and the
corrupted state then failed three unrelated tests.

**Root cause:** A no-op that reports success is indistinguishable from work. "Skipped file"
read as "nothing to do" rather than "refused to update", and because the write never landed,
the test that was aiming at the repo root looked harmless.

**Consequence:** Two silently wrong generated workflows shipped to every consumer, plus a
stale workflow in this repo. I also first "fixed" the single-branch case by deleting the
file, which was really a workaround for the skip — it would have made `generate` destructive
for no reason.

**Prevention:** When a generated file must reflect config, prove it _changes_: generate,
edit the config, regenerate, and assert the new value is present and the old one is gone.
`tests/integration/regenerate-managed-workflows.test.ts` does this for both files. When a
test shells out to the CLI, pass a temp `cwd` — never `process.cwd()` — because only
`pipeline.yml` honours an output override; everything else is cwd-relative. After changing
anything about how files are written, run the suite and check `git status` is clean.

## 2026-08-30 — Called the e2e sandbox repos "real repos" and skipped the one test that covered the change

**What happened:** After fixing single-branch flow handling, I declined to run
`pnpm exec tsx scripts/e2e/harness.ts` on the grounds that it "touches real repos" and
needed approval, and asserted that e2e "wouldn't have covered this change anyway, because
all the example configs are multi-branch." Both claims were wrong. The
`the-craftlab/pipecraft-example-*` repos are disposable sandboxes whose entire purpose is
to be reset and rebuilt. And `examples/library/.pipecraftrc.json` is
`{initialBranch: main, finalBranch: main, branchFlow: [main]}` — the single-branch case I
had just spent the session fixing. The live `pipecraft-example-library` repo was serving
the broken workflow, emitting `must target 'main' branch, not 'main'`.

**Root cause:** I read the harness header phrase "Operates on the live … repos" and stopped
reading. I never opened `scripts/e2e/flavors.ts` or the six `examples/*/.pipecraftrc.json`
files, so the sentence "all the example configs are multi-branch" was invented, not
observed. One `jq` across six files would have shown `library` immediately. I then stated
it as fact in a summary.

**Consequence:** Nearly shipped a single-branch fix without exercising the only e2e flavor
that covers single-branch. Burned two correction turns. Left a broken workflow live in the
example repo longer than necessary, and produced a summary containing a confident false
claim about test coverage.

**Prevention:** Before saying a test suite does not cover a change, enumerate what it covers
and show the evidence. For e2e here that is one command:
`for f in minimal library basic gated mixed remote; do jq -c '{i:.initialBranch,f:.finalBranch,flow:.branchFlow}' examples/$f/.pipecraftrc.json; done`.
"Disposable test fixture" and "live" are not opposites — check who owns a repo and what it
is for before treating destruction as a risk. See CLAUDE.md § "The e2e flavors are the real
test bed".

## 2026-08-30 — Ran the generator with cwd pointed at the Pipecraft repo itself

**What happened:** To generate a probe pipeline into a scratch directory I ran
`pnpm --dir "$WT" exec tsx src/cli/index.ts generate`. `pnpm --dir` sets the working
directory to the Pipecraft repo, and `generate` resolves output paths from `process.cwd()`,
so it ran against Pipecraft's own `.github/` and printed YAML duplicate-key errors from
Pipecraft's committed pipeline.

**Root cause:** Assumed `--dir` only affected package resolution. Also reached for
`--cwd` on the CLI first, which does not exist — the generator is cwd-driven with no flag
to override it.

**Consequence:** No damage, purely by luck: the additive-merge path hit "Skipped file" and
wrote nothing. Had the config differed it would have rewritten the repo's own workflows.
Cost a confused detour reading duplicate-key errors that had nothing to do with the probe.

**Prevention:** Invoke the CLI by `cd`-ing into the target directory and calling the binary
by absolute path — never via a package-manager flag that relocates cwd. Before any command
that writes generated files, confirm the effective cwd. See CLAUDE.md § "Verify by
generating, not by reading".

## 2026-08-30 — A test asserted on JSON quoting and hid a silently dropped function for months

**What happened:** `VersionManager.generateReleaseItConfig()` built a config object
containing a `whatBump` function and serialized it with `JSON.stringify`, which drops
function values. The emitted `.release-it.cjs` therefore had
`"@release-it/conventional-changelog": {}` — no `whatBump`, and `whatBump` is the only
consumer of `bumpRules`. The same method also read `versioning.bumpRules` while the schema
requires `semver.bumpRules`. The guarding test was
`expect(configString).toContain('"@release-it/conventional-changelog"')`, which passes on
the JSON-quoted key alone and is blind to both defects.

**Root cause:** The assertion tested that a string appeared in the output, not that the
configured behavior reached the output. It was labelled "should generate config with custom
bump rules" but never checked that any custom bump rule was present.

**Consequence:** Two real defects sat behind a green test. They also generated a false
upstream bug report (#483) claiming the _version calculator_ ignored `semver.bumpRules` —
it does not; the live template path was always correct. Investigating the wrong code path
cost the bulk of that fix's time.

**Prevention:** For any generator, assert that the input you configured appears in the
output with the value you gave it. Where the artifact is executable, `new Function(...)` it
and assert on the resulting object rather than on its text. A test whose name mentions a
config field must reference that field's value in an assertion. See CLAUDE.md § "Testing".
