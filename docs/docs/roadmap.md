# Roadmap & Known Limitations

PipeCraft currently focuses on trunk-based development with GitHub Actions. This page
covers what is on the immediate roadmap, known limitations you should be aware of
before adopting, and what is planned for the future.

The full technical roadmap with priority ratings and fix details lives in
[`ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/the-craftlab/pipecraft/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) at
the repository root.

## Known limitations

These are gaps in the current implementation that you should understand before
building on PipeCraft. None of them are silent — they are documented here so you
can plan around them.

### Promotion dispatch is fire-and-forget

When a branch promotes to the next stage, `promote-branch` dispatches the target
branch's pipeline via `gh workflow run` and immediately returns success. It does **not**
wait to verify that the triggered run actually started.

**What this means for you:** If the dispatch silently drops (misconfigured branch,
transient API error, rate limit), the promote job shows green and the target branch
never runs. Always verify the target branch actually shows a new run in the Actions
tab after a promotion.

**Workaround:** Check the Actions tab on the target branch after each promotion.

**Fix status:** Planned (P0-1 in ROADMAP.md) — add a post-dispatch poll to assert
the run appeared.

---

### No built-in rollback after a failed deployment

When a promotion PR merges and the deploy job on the target branch fails, there is
no Pipecraft-managed recovery path. The version tag is already on the target branch.

**Recommended recovery steps:**

1. Push a `fix:` commit to your initial branch (e.g., `develop`)
2. Let the pipeline re-run — it will produce a new patch version
3. The new version will promote normally through the branch flow
4. Avoid force-pushing the target branch — it breaks the linear history that
   PipeCraft's version model depends on

If the failure is catastrophic and you need to revert immediately, use
`git revert <merge-commit-sha>` on the target branch to create a revert commit that
safely undoes the merge without rewriting history.

**Fix status:** Documentation gap only (P1-2 in ROADMAP.md) — no generator change
needed; rollback is inherently environment-specific.

---

### Gate job needs manual updates when you add domains

When you add a new domain to `.pipecraftrc` and regenerate, the new domain's test
job is **not** automatically added to `gate.needs`. The gate job guards the version →
tag → promote chain, so a gate that passes without running all domain tests gives
false confidence.

**What to do:** After adding a domain and regenerating, manually add the new test
job to `gate.needs` in your workflow file. This customization survives future
regenerations.

**Fix status:** A future `pipecraft doctor` check will detect this gap (P2-4 in
ROADMAP.md).

---

### GitHub Actions only (GitLab planned)

PipeCraft currently generates GitHub Actions workflows only. The `ciProvider: gitlab`
config value is reserved but not implemented.

**Fix status:** P2-1 in ROADMAP.md — no timeline yet.

---

### Single workflow file (no sharding)

All domains are emitted into a single `pipeline.yml`. At 20+ domains this becomes
unwieldy in the GitHub Actions UI, and projects approaching 255 jobs per run could
hit GitHub's documented limit.

**Fix status:** P2-3 in ROADMAP.md — planned as a future architectural option, not
an immediate priority.

---

## What's coming next

These are the near-term priorities, in order:

**1. Verify promotion dispatch actually started (P0-1)**
After dispatching `gh workflow run`, poll the target branch's run list and emit a
warning (or fail) if the run doesn't appear within ~30 seconds. This closes the
silent-failure gap in the promotion chain.

**2. Publish Marketplace actions (P0-2)**
The `create-tag`, `promote-branch`, and `calculate-version` actions have been
readied for GitHub Marketplace but not yet published. Until they are, `remote`
action mode is non-functional. Publishing unblocks teams who want to reference
PipeCraft actions without copying them into their repo.

**3. Thread version through promotion (P1-1)**
Calculate the version on the initial branch and pass it explicitly as a
`workflow_dispatch` input to the target branch's pipeline. This eliminates the need
for `calculate-version` to re-derive the version on the target branch, removing the
main source of "no release was cut" failures.

**4. GitLab CI support (P2-1)**
Generate `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the same domain-based testing, semantic versioning,
and branch promotion features available to GitHub Actions users today.

**5. Additional branch flow patterns (P2-2)**
GitHub Flow (feature branches → main) and GitFlow (develop → release → main with
hotfixes) are planned after the current trunk-based model is fully hardened.

## Ideas under consideration

Several features are being evaluated but haven't been prioritized yet:

**Workflow visualization** would generate diagrams showing how code flows through
your pipeline. This helps teams understand and communicate their deployment process.

**Matrix builds** would let you test across multiple Node versions or operating
systems simultaneously. This is particularly useful for libraries that need to
support multiple environments.

**Deployment environments** would integrate with GitHub's environment protection
rules, adding manual approval gates and environment-specific secrets.

**Notifications** could alert your team on Slack or Discord when deployments happen
or tests fail.

These ideas need community feedback before they're prioritized. If one of these
would be valuable for your team, let us know through GitHub Issues or Discussions.

## How you can help

The roadmap is shaped by user feedback. If you want to influence what gets built
next:

- **Vote on existing feature requests** using GitHub issue reactions — issues with
  more upvotes get higher priority
- **Open new feature requests** if you need something not listed — describe your
  use case in detail, not just a solution
- **Contribute code** if you're comfortable with TypeScript and GitHub Actions —
  pull requests for both bug fixes and new features are welcome
- **Join discussions** on GitHub Discussions to share ideas and debate approaches
