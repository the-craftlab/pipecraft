### Summary of Pre-1.0 Development

PipeCraft has been in active internal development through versions 0.0.1 to 0.28.2. Key features developed:

#### Core Features

- **Trunk-Based Development Flow**: Automated CI/CD pipeline generation for develop → staging → main workflows
- **Domain-Based Change Detection**: Intelligent path-based and Nx-based change detection to run only affected jobs
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automated version calculation using conventional commits
- **Branch Flow Management**: Configurable multi-stage promotion with version gating
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Complete workflow and composite action generation

#### Advanced Capabilities

- **Nx Monorepo Support**: Full integration with Nx workspaces including:
  - Automatic Nx detection and configuration
  - Project-to-domain mapping
  - Dependency graph-aware change detection
  - Sequential task execution with Nx caching
- **AST-Based Workflow Merging**: Preserves user customizations during workflow regeneration
- **Custom Job Preservation**: User-defined jobs survive regeneration
- **Idempotent Generation**: Safe to regenerate workflows without losing manual changes

#### CLI Commands
